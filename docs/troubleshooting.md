# Troubleshooting Tips for Kubernetes GPU Node Setup

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. NVIDIA Driver Installation Fails
- **Symptoms**: The NVIDIA drivers do not install correctly, or the installation script exits with an error.
- **Solution**: Ensure that the system meets the prerequisites for the NVIDIA driver installation. Check the logs generated by the installation script for specific error messages. You may need to update your kernel or install additional dependencies.

### 2. GPU Not Detected by Kubernetes
- **Symptoms**: Pods requesting GPU resources are not scheduled, or the GPU is not listed in the node resources.
- **Solution**: Verify that the NVIDIA device plugin DaemonSet is running. Check the logs of the DaemonSet for any errors. Ensure that the NVIDIA drivers are correctly installed and that the kubelet is configured to recognize GPU resources.

### 3. Container Runtime Configuration Issues
- **Symptoms**: Containers fail to start or cannot access GPU resources.
- **Solution**: Check the configuration files for containerd or CRI-O to ensure that they are set up to support NVIDIA GPUs. Review the logs of the container runtime for any error messages related to GPU access.

### 4. Insufficient GPU Resources
- **Symptoms**: Pods requesting GPUs are pending due to insufficient resources.
- **Solution**: Check the GPU allocation on the node. If all GPUs are in use, consider scaling your cluster or optimizing the resource requests of your pods.

### 5. Compatibility Issues
- **Symptoms**: Errors related to version mismatches between Kubernetes, NVIDIA drivers, and the device plugin.
- **Solution**: Ensure that you are using compatible versions of Kubernetes, the NVIDIA drivers, and the NVIDIA device plugin. Refer to the official documentation for compatibility matrices.

### 6. General Debugging Steps
- Check the status of all relevant pods and DaemonSets using `kubectl get pods -n kube-system`.
- Review the logs of the kubelet and container runtime for any error messages.
- Use `nvidia-smi` on the node to verify that the NVIDIA drivers are functioning correctly.
