# Architecture of the GPU-Enabled Kubernetes Setup

This document outlines the architecture of a Kubernetes setup that is enhanced with NVIDIA GPU support. The architecture is designed to facilitate the deployment and management of GPU resources within a Kubernetes cluster, enabling workloads that require high-performance computing.

## Overview

The architecture consists of several key components:

1. **Kubernetes Cluster**: The core of the setup, where all containerized applications run. The cluster is configured to support GPU workloads.

2. **NVIDIA GPU Drivers**: Installed on each node that requires GPU support. These drivers enable the Kubernetes nodes to communicate with the NVIDIA GPUs.

3. **Container Runtimes**: The setup supports multiple container runtimes, including:
   - **containerd**: A lightweight container runtime that is configured to manage GPU resources.
   - **CRI-O**: An alternative container runtime that also supports GPU workloads.

4. **NVIDIA Device Plugin**: A DaemonSet that runs on each node, allowing Kubernetes to discover and manage GPU resources. This plugin exposes the GPUs to the Kubernetes scheduler.

5. **GPU Operator**: A DaemonSet that automates the deployment and management of NVIDIA GPU resources, ensuring that the necessary components are always running and up-to-date.

6. **Infrastructure Provisioning**: The setup includes Terraform scripts for provisioning the underlying infrastructure, ensuring that the nodes are configured correctly for GPU support.

7. **Configuration Management**: Ansible playbooks and roles are used to automate the installation and configuration of NVIDIA drivers and container runtimes.

8. **Testing and Validation**: Integration and unit tests are included to validate the setup and ensure that GPU workloads can be deployed successfully.

## Workflow

1. **Provisioning**: Use Terraform to provision the infrastructure required for the Kubernetes cluster with GPU support.

2. **Driver Installation**: Execute the installation scripts to install NVIDIA GPU drivers on the nodes.

3. **Runtime Configuration**: Configure the container runtimes (containerd and CRI-O) to support GPU workloads.

4. **Deploying GPU Resources**: Deploy the NVIDIA device plugin and GPU operator using the provided Kubernetes manifests.

5. **Testing**: Run integration tests to validate that GPU-enabled pods can be deployed and function correctly within the cluster.

## Conclusion

This architecture provides a robust framework for deploying and managing GPU workloads in a Kubernetes environment. By leveraging NVIDIA's tools and Kubernetes' extensibility, users can efficiently run high-performance applications that require GPU resources.
