# Prerequisites for Setting Up a Kubernetes Node with NVIDIA GPU Support

Before you begin setting up a Kubernetes node with NVIDIA GPU support, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **Hardware Requirements**:
   - A physical or virtual machine with an NVIDIA GPU. Ensure that the GPU is supported by the NVIDIA driver version you plan to install.

2. **Operating System**:
   - A compatible Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL) that supports the NVIDIA drivers and Kubernetes.

3. **NVIDIA Driver**:
   - The appropriate NVIDIA driver must be installed on the node. Refer to the NVIDIA documentation for the correct driver version for your GPU.

4. **Container Runtime**:
   - Either containerd or CRI-O must be installed and configured to support NVIDIA GPUs. Ensure that you have the necessary configuration files ready.

5. **Kubernetes Cluster**:
   - A running Kubernetes cluster where the node will be added. Ensure that you have administrative access to the cluster.

6. **kubectl**:
   - The Kubernetes command-line tool (`kubectl`) should be installed and configured to communicate with your Kubernetes cluster.

7. **Network Configuration**:
   - Ensure that the node can communicate with the Kubernetes API server and other nodes in the cluster.

8. **Permissions**:
   - Sufficient permissions to install software and configure the system on the node.

9. **Ansible (Optional)**:
   - If you plan to use the Ansible playbook for setup, ensure that Ansible is installed on your control machine.

10. **Terraform (Optional)**:
    - If you plan to provision infrastructure using Terraform, ensure that Terraform is installed and configured.

Make sure to verify each of these prerequisites before proceeding with the installation and configuration of the Kubernetes node with NVIDIA GPU support.
